## 💡 Introduction

**TextPixs** is a dynamic text-to-image generation platform built for users who want quick, compelling visuals. It is a research-based project focused on turning text into vibrant, detailed images, powered by cutting-edge generative AI technology.

The project addresses the significant challenge of accurate image generation and text rendering within images, which currently limits applications in educational tools, design automation, and digital art. Existing issues include ambiguity in text prompts, alignment challenges, and a lack of robust loss functions for text fidelity.

Our primary objectives include:
- Enhancing the rendering of images via text-to-image generation using state-of-the-art techniques.
- Improving text fidelity and visual quality in generated images.
- Developing a novel hybrid architecture with semantic alignment and text rendering loss.

TextPixs intends to bridge the gap between ideas and visuals, providing users with a creative playground for generating, modifying, and refining images. Our purpose is to research and contribute breakthroughs in achieving excellence in text-to-image generation, with a focus on text fidelity improvements to advance applications in content creation, advertising, and human-computer interactions.

## Features 🚀

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Input a description, and TextPixs will create a high-quality image that matches your vision. This feature leverages a hybrid architecture incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a Generator and Discriminator, and integrates a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for robust image synthesis.
- **Image Modifications** (Phase 2): Modify existing images using text prompts for further customization and creativity.
- **Text-to-Video Capabilities** (Future Phase): Generate short videos from descriptive prompts.

## Technologies Used 🛡️

- **Backend**: Flask, Python (Note: This is based on FYP1 deliverables. Actual implementation details for FYP2 may vary.)
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS (Note: This is based on FYP1 deliverables. Actual implementation details for FYP2 may vary.)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Note: This is based on FYP1 deliverables. Actual implementation details for FYP2 may vary.)
- **AI/ML Models**: Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion Model, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch.

## Roadmap 🗺️

Our project roadmap is structured into phases, with iterative progress on deliverables:

- **Initiation Phase (July - August 2024)**: Project setup and initial planning.
- **Literature Review (August - September 2024)**: Comprehensive review of existing research.
- **Gap Analysis (September - November 2024)**: Identification of research gaps and unique contributions.
- **Research Design and Planning (November 2024 - January 2025)**: Detailed design of the hybrid architecture and experimental setup.
- **Data Collection (January - April 2025)**: Gathering and preparing datasets for model training.
- **Data Analysis and Interpretation (March - May 2025)**: Analyzing experimental results and drawing conclusions.
- **Drafting Research Paper (November 2024 - May 2025)**: Writing the final research paper.
- **Final Review & Submission on Selected Journal (May - June 2025)**: Preparing for submission to a journal like CVPR.
- **Documentations & FYP Report (June - July 2025)**: Finalizing all project documentation and the FYP report.
