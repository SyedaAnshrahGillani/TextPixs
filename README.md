## About TextPixs 🖌️

**TextPixs** is a dynamic text-to-image generation platform built for users who want quick, compelling visuals. It is a research-based project focused on turning text into vibrant, detailed images, powered by cutting-edge generative AI technology.

The project addresses the significant challenge of accurate image generation and text rendering within images, which currently limits applications in educational tools, design automation, and digital art. Existing issues include ambiguity in text prompts, alignment challenges, and a lack of robust loss functions for text fidelity.

Our primary objectives include:
- Enhancing the rendering of images via text-to-image generation using state-of-the-art techniques.
- Improving text fidelity and visual quality in generated images.
- Developing a novel hybrid architecture with semantic alignment and text rendering loss.

## Vision 🌟

TextPixs intends to bridge the gap between ideas and visuals, providing users with a creative playground for generating, modifying, and refining images. Our purpose is to research and contribute breakthroughs in achieving excellence in text-to-image generation, with a focus on text fidelity improvements to advance applications in content creation, advertising, and human-computer interactions.

## Features 🚀

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Input a description, and TextPixs will create a high-quality image that matches your vision. This feature leverages a hybrid architecture incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a Generator and Discriminator, and integrates a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for robust image synthesis.
- **Image Modifications** (Phase 2): Modify existing images using text prompts for further customization and creativity.
- **Text-to-Video Capabilities** (Future Phase): Generate short videos from descriptive prompts.




## Technologies Used 🛡️

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML Models**: Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion Model, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch.
